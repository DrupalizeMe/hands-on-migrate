# Every migration must have a source plugin. Set this to the ID of the plugin to
# use.
#
# This is the extract phase of your migration.
#
# For our custom migration this should be the source plugin we wrote.
# \Drupal\baseball_migration\Plugin\migrate\source\BaseballPlayer The value here is
# the ID value from the source plugin's annotation.
source:
  plugin: player_award

# Every migration must also have a destination plugin, which handles writing
# the migrated data in the appropriate form for that particular kind of data.
# This value should be the ID of the destination plugin to use.
#
# This is the load phase of your migration.
destination:
  plugin: entity:node

# Here's the meat of the migration - the processing pipeline. This describes how
# each destination field is to be populated based on the source data. For each
# destination field, one or more process plugins may be invoked.
#
# This is the transform phase of your migration.
process:
  # Hardcode the destination node type (bundle) as 'player' using the
  # 'default_value' process plugin.
  type:
    plugin: default_value
    default_value: player_award

  # Simple field mappings that require no extra processing can use the default
  # 'get' process plugin. This just copies the value from the source to the
  # destination. 'get' is the default when no plugin is defined, so you can just
  # do destination_field: source_field.
  #
  # The destination field (or property) name goes on the left and the source
  # field goes on the right.
